Introduction:
Developing and maintaining undergraduate research programs benefits students, faculty mentors, and the university. Incorporating a research component along with a sound academic foundation enables in developing independent critical thinking skills along with oral and written communication skills. The research process impacts valuable learning objectives that have lasting influence as undergraduates prepare for professional service. Faculty members at teaching-intensive institutions can enhance learning experiences for students while benefiting from a productive research agenda. The university will benefit from presentations and publications that increase visibility in the scientific community.

Faculty members are tasked with discovering and creating new knowledge and sharing that knowledge – as well as their systematic methods of acquiring it – with students. Faculty members who perform research gain the respect of their colleagues, stay at the forefront of their fields and can share their disciplines’ latest developments with students. They tend to collaborate with scholars from other universities, consider new interpretations and methods, and bring valuable grant funding to the university.

The biggest challenge faced by universities is the organization and integration of all research data in one single platform. Scholars are now producing, storing, and disseminating digital data in much larger volumes. We aim to provide a solution to this ongoing issue. We have discussed and collected various requirements and data from various faculties, conducting research activities across various departments.In this project, our primary goal is to achieve the availability and accessibility of research-based data across various departments of the college. This also aims to fulfil the purpose of long term preservation of data. This project will assist the faculty members in conducting research activities to log and modify their data with a user-friendly UI.

Literature survey:
1. MySQL:

MySQL is a fast, easy-to-use RDBMS being used for many small and big businesses. It is developed, marketed and supported by MySQL AB, which is a Swedish company.
MySQL is becoming so popular because of many good reasons −It is released under an open-source license. So, you have nothing to pay to use it, it is a very powerful program in its own right and handles a large subset of the functionality of the most expensive and powerful database packages. MySQL uses a standard form of the well-known SQL data language. It works on many operating systems and with many languages including PHP, PERL, C, C++, JAVA, etc and works very quickly and works well even with large data sets.

2. PYTHON  FLASK:

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.

3. CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the
.css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

4. HTML:

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as
<img/> and <input/> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

5. JAVASCRIPT:
   
JavaScript abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax,
 
dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers, usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.

Conclusion: 

UNIVERSITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM successfully implemented based on online data filling which helps us in administrating the data user for managing the tasks performed in students. The project successfully used various functionalities of Xampp and python flask and also create the fully functional database management system for online portals.
Using MySQL as the database is highly beneficial as it is free to download, popular and can be easily customized. The data stored in the MySQL database can easily be retrieved and manipulated according to the requirements with basic knowledge of SQL.
With the theoretical inclination of our syllabus it becomes very essential to take the atmost advantage of any opportunity of gaining practical experience that comes along. The building blocks of this Major Project “Students Management System” was one of these opportunities.
It gave us the requisite practical knowledge to supplement the already taught theoretical concepts thus making us more competent as a computer engineer. The project from a personal point of view also helped us in understanding the following aspects of project development:

•	The planning that goes into implementing a project.
•	The importance of proper planning and an organized methodology.
•	The key element of team spirit and co-ordination in a successful project.

Future Enhancement:

•	Expand website accessibility by deploying it on internet with a custom domain name for enhanced online
 presence
•	Online feedbacks forms and result systems
•	Enhanced user-friendly GUI.
